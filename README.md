# GLOV - Graphics Library over Vulkan

This is going to be a C++ library for graphics programmers providing higher-level interface over Vulkan.

Despite "GL" letters in it's name, it has nothing to do with OpenGL.

The project is still in early stage of development. Please come again later unless you are interested in its development process.
